# Decision Tree on Iris Dataset

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree algorithm for classifying the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset contains three classes of iris plants with four features each.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-iris.git
cd decision-tree-iris
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1. Navigate to the notebooks directory and open the  notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to see the implementation and results of the Decision Tree classifier.
## Results
The Decision Tree classifier achieved an accuracy of 100 % on the Iris dataset. Detailed evaluation metrics are provided in the notebook.
